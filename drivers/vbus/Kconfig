       Adds support for a virtual-bus model drivers in a guest to connect
	to host side virtual-bus resources.  If you are using this kernel
	in a virtualization solution which implements virtual-bus devices
	on the backend, say Y.  If unsure, say N.

       depends on PCI

       default n
       help
        Provides a way to bridge host side vbus devices via a PCI-BRIDGE
        object.  If you are running virtualization with vbus devices on the
	host, and the vbus is exposed via PCI, say Y.  Otherwise, say N.
