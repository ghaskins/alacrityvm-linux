        Provides a virtual ethernet adapter to a vbus, which in turn
        manifests itself as a standard netif based adapter to the
	kernel.  It can be used similarly to a "tuntap" device,
        except that the char-dev transport is replaced with a vbus/ioq
        interface.

	If unsure, say N

       depends on VBUS_DEVICES && MACVLAN
       select VBUS_VENETDEV
       default n
       help
        Provides a vbus based virtual ethernet adapter with a macvlan
        device as its backend.

	If unsure, say N
