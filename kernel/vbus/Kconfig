        Provides a mechansism for declaring virtual resource containers
	and virtual-devices within those containers.  These devices may
	then be accessed by any context that cohabitates the same
	container, providing direct host-kernel access in a controlled
	manner.

	If you plan on using this kernel as a VBUS backend, say Y.  If
	unsure, say N
